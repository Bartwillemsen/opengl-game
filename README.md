# OpenGL Practical example

This project is kind of a practical example of all the things we learned during our Computer Graphics school lectures. But
instead of dumping everything in the main() function, I try to organize everything the right way in an object oriented way.
This will hopefully make the concepts learned more clear for me, and also maybe for others.

Because it is meant as a reference for learning, the whole source code contains plenty of comments to describe what everything
does.

## External libraries

The project makes use of a few external libraries:
- LWJGL
- Slick Utils

The native libraries for Windows are provided. If you use another platform (eg, Linux) you should include the LWJGL natives
yourself.
